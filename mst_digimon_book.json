This Digimon possesses incredibly powerful defensive and offensive abilities, equivalent to a Mega Digimon or even greater. No matter the predicament, the Digi-Egg of Miracles gives its wielder the power to overcome it, true to its name. Magnamon’s special moves are Plasma Shot, which fires ball-shaped plasma at the opponent, and Shining Gold Solar Storm, which rapidly compresses space and then expands it explosively, creating a ray of golden light which consumes enemies in the surrounding area with a single swoop.\n• Effects of the X-Antibody on Magnamon's DigiCore\nThe one-of-a-kind Chrome Digizoid is said to amplify one's strength after a Digimon has mastered it. Magnamon's virtual super-metal has completely merged with its Chrome Digizoid, allowing the metal to grow and decline like muscle tissue. It is thought that the inherent nature of Chrome Digizoid (Digi-Egg of Miracles) is to fuse with lifeforms, and this miraculous evolution of Magnamon’s was only made possible due to its unique ability to harness that nature in an almost pure Chrome Digizoid, created through the use of ancient technology. When Magnamon strains its Chrome Digizoid muscles, its entire body glows gold temporarily, granting the Digimon an impenetrable defense able to repel physical attacks and even data destruction. This Gold Digizoid mode offers characteristics similar to Chrome Digizoid in its raw form—Fanglong Ore—which boasts a degree of hardness that is unparalleled. The metal's relative density normally makes it impossible for Digimon to use, but Magnamon's meticulous training has enabled it to overcome this limitation.",

			"profile": "The strongest dragon warrior whose body is clad in armor of the super-metal \"Chrome Digizoid,\" WarGreymon is a Mega form of the Greymon-species Digimon. Although it takes a more humanoid form over the giant dinosaur figure, it has greatly improved both its strength and speed. It would most likely be impossible for an Ultimate Digimon to defeat it. The Dramon Killer blades equipped on both of its arms are highly effective against Dramon-type Digimon but are double-edged swords, placing its own life at risk as well. The shells on its back can be combined to form the Brave Shield. It is said when a true hero among veteran warriors awaken to its mission, it can Digivolve to WarGreymon. Its special move, Terra Force, collects all energies within the atmosphere into one condensed bolt of extremely dense high-temperature energy and shoots it out.\nImpact of the X-Antibody on WarGreymon's DigiCore\nIt must win 100% of its battles due to its sense of duty as a true hero. One of its weapons, Dramon Killer, which is as sturdy and reliable as the Brave Shield, is perfect for both defense and offense. In addition, this Digimon is equipped with a vernier that boosts explosive speed at the expense of longer flight time. WarGreymon's fighting style means that it instantaneously lunges at its opponents' chest, making it the most powerful land-combat Digimon. It is nearly impossible to avoid its zero-range attack, Terra Force Zero, in which it shoots Terra Force at its opponents' chest at point blank range. When Dramon Killer and the vernier are combined, the attack is accelerated, resulting in Afterburst.",
